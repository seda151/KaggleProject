🎬 Netflix Data Analysis: Global Trends & Turkey Insights
This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Netflix dataset. I performed data cleaning, trend analysis, and a comparative study between global content and Turkish productions using Python and Pandas.

🚀 Key Features
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and converted string-based durations (e.g., "112 min") into integer formats for statistical analysis.

Global Trends: Analyzed the content growth spurt between 2015-2020.

Comparative Analysis: Conducted a deep dive into Turkish content, comparing average movie durations and production years against global averages.

🔍 Analytical Questions Addressed
1. Content Distribution
Total Records: 6,234 entries.

Findings: Movies (4,265) significantly outnumber TV Shows (1,969) in this dataset.

2. Temporal Analysis
Peak Years: Content production peaked between 2017 and 2019, with 2018 being the top year (1,063 releases).

Growth: A massive acceleration in content additions was observed after 2015.

3. Turkey Deep Dive 🇹🇷
Market Share: Turkey accounts for approximately 1.26% of the total Netflix library in this dataset.

Content Type: Turkish content is heavily skewed towards Movies (62) vs. TV Shows (25).

Duration Insight: * Turkish Movies Average: 108 minutes

Global Movies Average: 99 minutes

Insight: Turkish productions are, on average, 9 minutes longer than the global average.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python: Core language for analysis.

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

Matplotlib: For visualizing trends and growth curves.

Kaggle: Development environment.
